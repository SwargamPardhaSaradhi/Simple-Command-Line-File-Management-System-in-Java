# Simple-Command-Line-File-Management-System-in-Java
This Java-based file management system simulates a directory structure using linked lists. Users can create folders/files, navigate directories (cd &lt;foldername>, cd ..), and display contents (display -d, display -f). The system tracks the current directory and updates dynamically, offering a simple yet effective file system simulation.
